# CC2-32K-EPROM-CARTRIDGE-2012-V2R0
This is an EPROM Cartridge for the Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 1,2 and 3. It will probably work with the Dragon Data Dragon computers as well. It uses a 27C512 EPROM jumper selected as two 32K banks. The CoCo 1, 2 and Dragon can only access the first 16K of each bank. The CoCo 3 can access the entire 32K of each bank, minus the 0xFFnn I/O and Vector page. The project has been shared to OSHPark: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/wl9Kmtit. Many other similar cartridges are forthcoming, There are much better designs in my possession and I intend to post them all, in no particular order.
